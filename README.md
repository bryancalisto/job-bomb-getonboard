# Job Bomb
This app is aimed to be used in universities or any other place where potential employees may be.
The idea behind it is simple: Give people a job search engine that allows them to search jobs based on keywords that they speak aloud and make it a publicity barrier for jobs in a public venue.

#### How to run it:
Install Node >12.0 and npm, Go to 'frontend' directory, run 'npm i' and 'npm start'.

## User guide

#### COMMANDS
- ***Clear: ***Clears the current search criteria.
- ***Show [number]: *** Displays a QR code that contains the link to the job offer referenced by it's '#' column.
- ***Close:*** Closes the previously displayed QR code.
